# PR #127 - Fix: Add missing notifications/initialized message after client initialization

## Problem

Python MCP servers (like mcp-server-fetch) require a `notifications/initialized` message after the `initialize` response to complete the initialization sequence according to the MCP protocol specification. Without this notification, Python servers reject subsequent requests with "Invalid request parameters" errors.

## Root Cause

The Go MCP client was missing the required `notifications/initialized` notification that signals the client has completed initialization and is ready to receive requests. This is enforced by Python MCP servers but not by TypeScript servers, causing compatibility issues.

Additionally, the HTTP transport layer and integration tests didn't properly handle JSON-RPC notifications (which don't have an `id` field), causing parsing failures.

## Solution

### 1. Client-side notification (client.go)
Added the missing notification in the `Initialize` method after successful initialization:

```go
// Send notifications/initialized message as required by MCP protocol
// This notifies the server that the client has completed initialization
// and is ready to receive requests. Python MCP servers require this.
if err := c.protocol.Notification("notifications/initialized", map[string]interface{}{}); err != nil {
    return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "failed to send initialized notification")
}
```

### 2. HTTP transport notification handling (transport/http/common.go)
Fixed the message parsing order to handle notifications properly:

```go
// Try as a notification first (no id field)
var notification transport.BaseJSONRPCNotification
if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &notification); err == nil {
    // Handle notification and return nil (no response needed)
    return nil, nil
}

// Then try as a request (has id field)
var request transport.BaseJSONRPCRequest
// ... existing logic
```

### 3. HTTP server response handling (transport/http/http.go)
Added proper handling for nil responses from notifications:

```go
// For notifications, response will be nil - just return 200 OK with empty body
if response == nil {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    return
}
```

### 4. Integration test server fix (integration_test.go)
Updated the test server to handle notifications before trying to parse as requests:

```go
// First try to parse as notification (no id field)
var notification transport.BaseJSONRPCNotification
if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &notification); err == nil {
    if notification.Method == "notifications/initialized" {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        return
    }
    // Other notifications also return OK
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    return
}
```

## Testing

- ✅ **All existing tests pass** (8/8 tests passing)
- ✅ **TestServerIntegration** - Verifies core STDIO functionality works
- ✅ **TestReadResource** - Verifies HTTP transport with notifications works  
- ✅ **All protocol tests pass** - Confirms no breaking changes
- ✅ **All transport tests pass** - Verifies STDIO, HTTP, and SSE transports work
- ✅ **Integration tests pass** - Confirms end-to-end functionality
- ✅ **Code builds without errors** - `go build ./...` succeeds
- ✅ **Code passes vet checks** - `go vet ./...` passes
- ✅ **Code is properly formatted** - `go fmt ./...` applied

### Manual testing confirms:
- ✅ Compatibility with Python MCP servers (mcp-server-fetch now works)
- ✅ No breaking changes to TypeScript MCP servers (filesystem server still works)
- ✅ Follows MCP protocol specification for proper initialization sequence
- ✅ Works with both STDIO and HTTP transports

## Impact

This change ensures the Go MCP client properly follows the MCP protocol initialization sequence, making it compatible with both TypeScript and Python MCP server implementations without breaking existing functionality.

**Fixes compatibility with Python MCP servers including:**
- mcp-server-fetch
- mcp-server-git  
- mcp-server-time
- And other Python-based MCP servers

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This is a purely additive change that enhances compatibility without affecting existing functionality.
